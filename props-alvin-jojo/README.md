As a user, I can see an application called Dice Roller
    As a developer, I can create a React application with App.js as my stateful component
    As a developer, I can create two child components that will accept props from App.js]

As a user, I can click a box and see the outcome of my current "roll"
    As a developer, I can pass a method from App.js to my dice component to display a number between 1 and 6
    
As a user, I can see my roll logged
    As a developer, I can pass the value of the roll to a log component

As a user, I can see the roll log continue to grow as I roll the dice


App.js
- Method for random number between 1-6
- Render/return for the Dice/Rolls

Dice.js
- Button
    - Will also be a display for number that is rolled

Rolls.js
- Track previous rolls
